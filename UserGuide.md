# Gravity-Waves-Analysis-Tool


## Introduction

Hello, thank you for using the Gravity Wave analysis tool. This tool was created in a semester-long project course called CSC 380 at Suny Oswego University. This tool was also made with the help form Dr.Barber,
Dr.Kanbur and Dr.Tenbergen at Suny Oswego University and Dr.Gong at the NASA Goddard Space center. This tool is great for quick analysis of Radiosonde Data to get a set list of parameters from GDL, and a set list
of Graphs. These results will be placed into a PDF which you can then download onto your computer for use outside of our website.
