# Gravity-Waves-Analysis-Tool


## Introduction

Hello, thank you for using the Gravity Wave analysis tool. This tool was created in a semester-long project course called CSC 380 at Suny Oswego University. This tool was also made with the help form Dr.Barber,
Dr.Kanbur and Dr.Tenbergen at Suny Oswego University and Dr.Gong at the NASA Goddard Space center. This tool is great for quick analysis of Radiosonde Data to get a set list of parameters from GDL, and a set list
of Graphs. These results will be placed into a PDF which you can then download onto your computer for use outside of our website.

######Special Thanks to:
Special thanks to:
Dr.Barber for suggesting such great additions and features and helping us with all the science behind this tool. 
Dr.Kanbur for meeting with us and connecting us with Dr.Gong and helping orientate ourselves when this project started. 
Dr.Gong for being our lighthouse and giving us the code needed to run GDL. Your work and effort put into that code has made this project possible and for visiting us at suny oswego.
Dr.Tenbergen for helping us be the best we could be and for pushing us to work hard everyday. This project would have long ago failed if it was not for your constant guidance, support and teaching that you do everyday. Keep being awesome.
